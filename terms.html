<p align="center">Effective: November 2016</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 1 - CORPORATE MISSION STATEMENT</span></strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to create an environment where our employees, Consultants and company managers are aligned to accomplish one goal, to build beautiful lives.&nbsp; We will do this by offering quality products at a fair price; by treating everyone we come in contact with respect and will do all we can to treat our customers as family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p>Kalo, LLC and its affiliated brands. By accepting this contract with Kalo, LLC, you are authorized to distribute selected products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.1 - What&rsquo;s in the Consultant Agreement?</strong></p>
<p>Kalo Policies and Procedures are considered part of the Consultant Agreement.</p>
<p>In its entirety, the Consultant Agreement includes:</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>The Consultant Application and Agreement;</li>
<li>The Policies and Procedures;</li>
<li>The Kalo Compensation Plan (Pay Plan); and</li>
<li>The Kalo Business Entity Registration Form (if applicable).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Kalo refers to the <em>Consultant Agreement</em> or <em>Agreement</em>, it refers to all components as described above. It is your responsibility to read, understand, and adhere to the most recent version of the Agreement. Likewise, when you sponsor a new Consultant, it is your responsibility to ensure they have read and understand the Agreement they are signing, particularly these Policies and Procedures and the Kalo Compensation Plan, before they sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.2 - Why Do We Need These Policies?</strong></p>
<p>The Policies and Procedures are designed to define the relationship that exists between you (as an Consultant), Kalo and other Kalo Consultants, and to clearly articulate a standard for acceptable business conduct. By signing the Agreement, you are required to comply with all of its Terms and Conditions, with these Policies and Procedures, and with all federal, state, and local laws governing your Kalo business and conduct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding any policy or rule, do not hesitate to ask your Sponsor or contact Kalo Consultant Support by emailing <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.3 - How Are Policy Changes Handled?</strong></p>
<p>Kalo reserves the right to update or change the Agreement and/or its Compensation Plan, including these Policies and Procedures. However, if we make changes or revisions, you will be notified through official Kalo publications or through your ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup>. By electronically accepting this Agreement, continuing as an Consultant, or by accepting future bonuses or commissions, you signal your acceptance of any changes that are made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.4 - Business Delays Beyond Kalo&rsquo;s Control</strong></p>
<p>Kalo is not responsible for business delays due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, such as labor strikes and difficulties, riots, war, fire, natural disasters, death, curtailment of a party&rsquo;s source of supply, or government decrees or orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.5 - Handling Invalid or Unenforceable Policies</strong></p>
<p>If any part of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, only that invalid or unenforceable portion may be removed and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain intact and in force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.6 - Kalo&rsquo;s Right to Enforce Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Kalo never gives up its right to insist on compliance with the Agreement, including the Policies and Procedures. Even if Kalo chooses, for whatever reason, not to enforce compliance, this does not make any portion of the Agreement, including the Policies and Procedures, invalid, and it does not constitute a waiver of Kalo&rsquo;s right to enforce compliance with any term of the Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A waiver by Kalo is only valid if delivered in writing by an Authorized Representative of the Company and applies only to the specific instance or occurrence at hand. This written waiver does not limit or impair Kalo&rsquo;s right to insist on future compliance with the Consultant requesting a waiver, nor does it affect or impact in any way the compliance required of other Consultants, even in similar cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 3 - BECOMING AN CONSULTANT</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>3.1 - Requirements to Become an Consultant</strong></p>
<p>To become a Kalo Consultant, you must:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Be of the age of majority in your state of residence or country;</li>
<li>Reside in a geographical area where Kalo has been approved for business;</li>
<li>Have a valid Social Security or Federal Tax ID number;</li>
<li>Purchase a Starter Kit (except where prohibited by law);</li>
<li>Read and agree to abide by the Company&rsquo;s Statement of Policies and Procedures; and</li>
<li>Submit a properly completed Consultant Application and Agreement to Kalo.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Consultants enroll online at the Personal Website of a Sponsor. If you do not have a Sponsor and you would like one, please go to the Consultant locator found on the Kalo.com website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must complete the Consultant Agreement and agree to all terms and related documents yourself. An existing Consultant and/or your Sponsor must not fill out, sign, or accept the agreement on your behalf. See Section 7.4 for more information on sponsoring. Kalo reserves the right to reject any new Consultant Application and Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.1.1 - Country of Residence</strong></p>
<p>You must be a legal resident of the United States, or, if you are not a permanent resident, you must be legally authorized to work in the United States in order to enroll as a Kalo Consultant. If it is discovered that an individual has provided Kalo with false residency information or false tax ID information during enrollment, their account will be closed and they will lose any commissions not already paid out. Kalo communication, in any form, cannot encourage individuals to complete the enrollment process who are not legally authorized to work in countries where Kalo is registered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.2 - Can a Business Enroll as an Consultant?</strong></p>
<p>Certain business entities can apply to be a Kalo Consultant by submitting a Business Entity Registration Form and an Consultant Application and Agreement to Kalo, and by following instructions on the Team Office<sup>â</sup>. &nbsp;When “you”, “your”, and “Consultant” are used in these Policies and Procedures, they refer both to individuals and business entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any person or entity with a legal or equitable interest in the Consultant business agrees to all of the terms of the Agreement and these Policies and Procedures. If such person or entity violates or is out of compliance with the terms of the Agreement then the entire Consultant business is out of compliance and subject to disciplinary action as a single entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you joined Kalo as an individual but wish to change your status to a business entity, you may do so by following the steps outlined in Section 5.2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.3 - Identification</strong></p>
<p>Upon request or during the application process, you may be asked to provide your Social Security number (SSN) or a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) to Kalo. Your legal name and Social Security number must be entered as they appear on your Social Security card.&nbsp;Kalo is required by law to provide this information to the IRS for 1099 reporting purposes. Failure to comply may result in suspension or cancellation of your Kalo Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your application is submitted and accepted, Kalo will assign you a unique identification number, known as an Consultant ID Number that will be used by you and/or Consultant Support to place orders and track commissions and bonuses. Passwords consultant with these unique numbers should not be shared with others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.4- Consultant Benefits</strong></p>
<p>When your Consultant Application and Agreement has been accepted by Kalo, you have the right to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Sell products;</li>
<li>Participate in the Kalo Compensation Plan;</li>
<li>Recruit and sponsor other Consultants, Preferred &amp; Retail Customers (build your downline);</li>
<li>Receive Kalo literature and other communications;</li>
<li>Access Kalo-sponsored support, training, motivational, and recognition functions;</li>
<li>Participate in Kalo-sponsored promotional and incentive contests and programs; and</li>
<li>Receive access to an online ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup> that facilitates and records your business interactions with Kalo.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.5 - Renewal of Your Kalo Business</strong></p>
<p>When you join Kalo and sign the Consultant Agreement you also paid a registration fee which provided access to your Team Office and other support materials sometimes referred to as a starter kit.&nbsp; No one is required to purchase products to become a Kalo Consultant however the registration is required.&nbsp; Each year upon your enrollment anniversary the registration is automatically renewed for another one-year term, unless either you or Kalo provide the other party written notice of their intention not to renew the Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 4 - CONSULTANT RELATIONSHIP WITH KALO</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.1 - Independent Contractor Status</strong></p>
<p>When you join Kalo as an Consultant you are an independent contractor. You are not purchasing a franchise or a business opportunity and the Agreement between you and Kalo does not create an employer/employee relationship, partnership, or joint venture. As a result, you are solely responsible for paying all local, state, and federal taxes owed from any compensation earned. Additionally, Kalo will not treat you as an employee for federal tax purposes. This means that Kalo will not withhold FICA or taxes of any kind from your bonuses and commissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an independent contractor, you completely control the means by which you operate your Kalo businesses. You will establish your own goals, hours, and methods of sale — subject to compliance with the Agreement and applicable law. You are solely responsible for paying all expenses incurred in developing your business and are not authorized to incur any debt or obligation on behalf of or in the name of Kalo or other Consultants, or to open any checking account on behalf of, for, or in the name of Kalo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.2 - Non-Solicitation of Kalo Employees</strong></p>
<p>Kalo works hard to ensure it provides the best possible experience for its Consultants. In order to make this possible, we recruit and train employees for your benefit.&nbsp; Because it is expensive to recruit and train employees and critical for these employees to remain loyal to Kalo and to you, you are expressly prohibited, without Kalo&rsquo;s prior written permission, from soliciting, hiring, offering employment or compensation of any kind to, or otherwise using any services of any Kalo employee outside of the scope of his/her employment during the term of said employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.3 - No Territory Restrictions or Franchise Fees</strong></p>
<p>There are no exclusive territories granted to anyone for selling, recruiting, or marketing. No franchise fees are required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.4 - Income Taxes </strong></p>
<p>Kalo will provide an IRS Form 1099 MISC (Non-Employee Compensation) earnings statement to each U.S. Consultant who had earnings of $600 or more in the previous calendar year.&nbsp;You are solely responsible for paying local, state, and federal taxes on any income generated as an Consultant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.5 - Timely Reporting of Errors</strong></p>
<p>If you believe errors have been made regarding commissions, bonuses, charges, or the placement of Consultants in your downline organization, you must notify Kalo in writing within sixty (60) days of when the purported error or incident occurred. After sixty (60) day, payment, bonuses, rewards or charges are considers valid and may not be disputed, unless the payment, bonus, reward or charge was in excess of what Kalo should have awarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.6 - Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>By signing the Consultant Agreement, you agree to release, discharge, and hold harmless Kalo, and anyone directly affiliated with Kalo (employees, board of directors, officers, etc.), from any losses or damages, including costs and fees, incurred or suffered by you as a result of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Your breach of the Consultant Agreement (including these Policies and Procedures);</li>
<li>The improper promotion or operation of your Kalo business and any related activities (e.g., the presentation of Kalo&rsquo;s products or Compensation Plan, the operation of a motor vehicle, the lease of meeting or training facilities, web sites or Internet tools, including social media, etc.);</li>
<li>Any incorrect data or information provided by an Consultant to Kalo; or</li>
<li>Your failure to provide any information or data necessary for Kalo to operate its business.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.7 - Requests for Records </strong></p>
<p>Consultant requests for copies of invoices, applications, downline reports, or other records will require a minimum fee of $2.00 and $1.00 per page per copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.8 - Roll-Up of Downline Organization</strong></p>
<p>Kalo reserves the right to purge its database of an inactive or terminated Consultant(s). When this happens, Kalo may (or may not) modify the database in a manner that everyone shifts up one level; so the first level (or frontline) of the cancelled Consultant now becomes the first level (or frontline) of the cancelled Consultant&rsquo;s Sponsor. Where there is the possibility of there being multiple Sponsors, Kalo reserves the right to choose who the new frontline Sponsor will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.9 - Sale, Transfer, or Assignment of a Kalo Business</strong></p>
<p>Kalo allows for the sale or transfer of your business in the event you wish to retire from direct selling as defined below. Although your Kalo business is privately owned and independently operated, the Agreement, including these Policies and Procedures, is an agreement between you and Kalo. You may not assign any of the rights you are granted under the Agreement, without first obtaining written authorization from Kalo. Such authorization is at Kalo&rsquo;s discretion, and will only be granted if, in Kalo&rsquo;s opinion, the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Protection of the existing line of Sponsorship must always be maintained so that the Kalo business continues to be operated in that line of Sponsorship.&nbsp; The buyer must, in the opinion of Kalo, be qualified and have the skills, resources, and experience to appropriately carry on the seller&rsquo;s business and to manage the seller&rsquo;s downline.</li>
<li>The buyer or transferee must be (or must become) a qualified Kalo Consultant and be approved by Kalo. If the buyer is a current Kalo Consultant, he or she must first terminate their Kalo business simultaneously with the purchase, transfer, assignment, or acquisition of any interest in the new Kalo business.</li>
<li>Before the sale, transfer, or assignment can be finalized and approved by Kalo, any debt obligations the selling Consultant has with Kalo must be satisfied.</li>
<li>The selling Consultant must be in good standing and not in violation of any of the terms of the Agreement in order to be eligible to sell, transfer, or assign a Kalo business.</li>
<li>The selling Consultant must agree not to solicit or entice any other Consultants or Customers within the organization to move to a new position, if they rejoin Kalo under the same or new name.</li>
<li>The seller agrees not to solicit or entice any other Consultants or Customers into another direct selling company for a period of twelve (12) months following the effective date of the transfer. Any violation will result in the cancellation of the transferred account and disputes arising from the violation are between buyer and seller. Both buyer and seller must agree in writing to this provision.</li>
<li>Both the Seller and the Buyer must execute the Account Transfer Form, agreeing to the terms set forth here (located in the Resources tab, Business Builders section, in your Team Office) and email it to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to selling your Kalo business, you must notify Kalo&rsquo;s Compliance Department of your intent to sell. Upon complete execution of the purchase and sale agreement, you must submit a copy of it to Kalo for review. Kalo reserves the right to request additional documentation that may be necessary to analyze the transaction between the buyer and seller. Kalo will, at its sole and absolute discretion, approve or deny the sale, transfer, or assignment. If you fail to obtain Kalo&rsquo;s approval for the transaction, the transfer shall be voidable at Kalo&rsquo;s option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purchaser of the existing Kalo business will assume the obligations and position of the selling Consultant. Additionally, if you sell your Kalo business you will not be eligible to re-apply as a Kalo Consultant for at least six (6) full months after the date of the sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.10 - Separation of a Kalo Business due to Divorce or Business Break-Up </strong></p>
<p>When a Kalo business is jointly owned and operated by a husband-wife partnership, or across a business entity, there must be a way to equitably separate that Kalo business in the event of a divorce or the dissolution of the business entity. This separation must be handled in a way that does not adversely affect the interests and income of other businesses up or down the line of sponsorship. If the separating parties fail to provide for the best interests of other Consultants and the Company, Kalo will, at its sole discretion, terminate the Consultant and cancel the Consultant Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the pendency of a divorce or business break-up, you must adopt one of the following methods of operation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>One of the parties may, with consent of the other(s), operate the Kalo business pursuant to an assignment in writing whereby the relinquishing spouse, shareholders, partners, or trustees authorize Kalo to deal directly and solely with the other spouse or non-relinquishing shareholder, partner, or trustee.</li>
<li>The parties may continue to operate the Kalo business jointly on a <em>business-as-usual</em> basis, whereupon all compensation paid by Kalo will be paid in the joint names of the Consultants or in the name of the entity to be divided as the parties may independently agree between themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that you are unable to resolve a dispute over the disposition of commissions and ownership of the business, your Consultant Agreement will be involuntarily cancelled. Once a spouse or former business affiliate has completely given up their rights in their original Kalo business, they are free to enroll under any Sponsor of their choosing and develop their new business the same as any other new Consultant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.11 - Succession Due to Death or Incapacitation</strong></p>
<p>In the event of your death or incapacitation, your Kalo business may be passed to your heirs. For this to occur, the necessary legal documentation must be submitted to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. If you wish to bequeath your Kalo business, please work with an attorney to prepare a will (or other testamentary instrument). If you transfer your Kalo business in this manner, your beneficiary acquires the right to collect all bonuses and commissions from your downline organization, provided certain qualifications are met. The successor(s) must:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Execute a new Consultant Agreement;</li>
<li>Comply with terms and provisions of the Agreement; and</li>
<li>Meet all of the qualifications for the deceased Consultant&rsquo;s rank.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonuses and commissions of a Kalo business transferred in this manner will be paid in a single installment. If the business is bequeathed to joint devisees, they must form a business entity and acquire a federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). Kalo will issue all bonus and commission checks and one IRS Form 1099 to the business entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.11.1 - Transfer Upon Death of an Consultant</strong></p>
<p>To effect a testamentary transfer of a Kalo business, the successor must provide the following to Kalo:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>An original death certificate;</li>
<li>A notarized copy of the will or other instrument establishing the successor&rsquo;s right to the Kalo business; and</li>
<li>A completed and executed Consultant Agreement.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 5 - RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONSULTANTS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.1 - Change of Address or Telephone </strong></p>
<p>To avoid any disruption in your business, please notify Kalo at least two (2) weeks prior to your address and/or telephone number changing. You can easily make these changes on the Account Tab within your Team Office<sup>â</sup>.

<p>When you sponsor other Consultant(s), you must take a proactive role in providing assistance and training, ensure that new Consultants understand and comply with the Agreement, including these Policies and Procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Sponsor responsibilities may include, but are not limited to: written correspondence, personal meetings, telephone contact, voice mail, emails, and accompaniment to Kalo meetings, and other functions. It is Kalo&rsquo;s expectation that Sponsors provide support in regards to the Policies and Procedures, provide answers to questions, and be the first point of contact for the frontline to come to for support or training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>5.3.1 - Leadership Requirements</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.3.1.1 - Monthly Volume Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Volume requirements for each title are defined in the Compensation Plan, which may change from time to time and may be different, depending on the market of your residency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rank requirements for each title are defined in the Compensation Plan, which may change from time to time and may be different, depending on the market of your residency.</p>

A leader&rsquo;s responsibility is to his or her team and all generational leaders in his or her group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the responsibilities of a Sponsor, leaders are to provide regular team communications and opportunities to interact with team members as requested and needed.</p>

<p>Upon request, you must be able to provide documented evidence to Kalo of your ongoing fulfillment of the leadership requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consultants who do not wish to take a proactive role in providing assistance and training, and in ensuring those in their downline (1) are aware of Kalo Policies and Procedures; and (2) comply with the Agreement, Policies and Procedures; may have their accounts suspended and their commissions held until a resolution can be established with Kalo that supports fulfillment of Sponsor and leader obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Consultant wishes to challenge the suspended status on their account, challenges may be submitted to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.4 - Document Fulfillment of Leader Obligations</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.5 - Providing Documentation to Applicants</strong></p>
<p>When you sponsor a new Consultant, you must ensure they have access to and have reviewed the latest version of the Policies and Procedures and the Compensation Plan before the new Consultant signs the Consultant Agreement or signs up online.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.6 - Reporting Policy Violations</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.7 - Adherence to Laws and Ordinances</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.7.1 - Local Ordinances</strong></p>
<p>Many cities and counties have laws regulating certain home-based businesses. In most cases, these ordinances do not apply to Kalo Consultants; however, you must obey those laws that do apply. If a local government official informs you that an ordinance applies to you, please be polite and cooperative, and immediately send a copy of the ordinance to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. Kalo will work with you to understand and resolve the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.7.2 - Compliance with Federal, State, and Local Laws</strong></p>
<p>Consultants shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the conduct of their businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certain federal regulations govern the sales of Kalo merchandise. In order to comply with those regulations, you must ensure that the following information is contained on each sales receipt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 6 - MARKETING YOUR KALO BUSINESS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.1 - Adherence to the Kalo Marketing Plan</strong></p>
<p>As an Consultant, you are obligated to market and promote your Kalo business only as set forth in official Kalo literature and in a manner consistent with Kalo Policies and Procedures. You may not offer the Kalo opportunity through, or in conjunction with, any other system, program, or offering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2 - General </strong>(applying to both online and offline marketing and promotion)</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to safeguard and promote the good reputation of the Kalo brands; to ensure that your marketing efforts contribute to the public interest; and to avoid discourteous, deceptive, misleading, unethical, or immoral conduct or practices. Whenever promoting your business, you must identify yourself as an Independent Consultant of Kalo International.</p>
<p><strong>6.2.1 - Consultant Logo / Identity</strong></p>
<p>Kalo grants its Consultants a limited license to use the Consultant logos and other company approved materials located within the Team Office. This license allows you to use the Consultant materials in communications, including on approved websites, and on items you make for yourself or your team to conduct your Kalo businesses. This license may not be assigned to third parties to produce items for you or your teams. If you would like a third party to produce items that have any Kalo logos on them, or if you would like to use a logo other than the Consultant logos, you must first get written approval from <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. No other use of the Kalo logos or materials is permitted and no license for the use of any other Kalo marks, names, or logos is permitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.2 - Trademarks and Copyrights</strong></p>
<p>You may not use Kalo trade names, trademarks, copyrighted material, designs, images, or symbols without prior written permission, except as set forth in Section 6.2.1. Video or audio recordings of company events, training, and/or speeches are also copyrighted, and may not be utilized or distributed without written permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name <em>Kalo</em> as all unique products and product lines within the Kalo brand, are trademarks of Kalo, are of great value to the Company, and are supplied to you for your use only in an authorized manner. Use of the Kalo names on any item not produced or authorized by the Company in these Policies and Procedures or without specific written permission from the company is prohibited.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Consultant&rsquo;s Name] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are not allowed to use the name <em>Kalo, Kalo LLC, </em>in any form in your team name, a tagline, an external website name, your Personal Website address or extension, in an email address, as a personal name, or as a nickname. Additionally, only use the phrase <em>Independent [brand name (e.g. Kalo] [title (e.g. Consultant, Consultant, Active Consultant, etc.)] </em>in your phone greeting or on your answering machine to clearly separate your Kalo business from Kalo. For example, you may not secure the domain name <a href="http://www.buyscentsy.com/">www.buyKalo.com</a>; nor may you create an email address such as <a href="mailto:FinallyDistributor@gmail.com">KaloConsultant@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>There are numerous words, images, phrases, taglines, and/or ideas developed or coined within the Kalo community, and used by Consultants to promote Kalo, their Kalo business, or their Kalo team. No Consultant can claim the exclusive right to use such words, images, phrases, taglines, or ideas that are in the Kalo <em>community domain</em> for use by all Kalo Consultants. Therefore, you are not allowed to claim ownership of any such words, images, phrases, taglines, or names, and agree that you will not seek to register any such words, images, phrases, taglines, or names as a trademark, copyright, or domain name. If you do, you agree to assign to Kalo any such trademark application or registration, or copyright or domain registration to Kalo upon registration or upon their request. In addition, Kalo may elect to take disciplinary action against you as provided in Section 12. By entering into the Consultant Agreement and/or renewing your Consultant Agreement, you hereby assign any rights that you may have to or in any such intellectual property to Kalo and you further agree that Kalo may, at its discretion, seek to register any such words, images, phrases, taglines, or names as trademarks, copyrights, or domain names, as the case may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.3 - Submission of Business or Other Ideas to Kalo</strong></p>
<p>While Kalo appreciates the feedback and ideas that Consultants have for improving our existing products or creating new ones, please understand that we do not compensate Consultants or others for unsolicited submissions of business, product, or creative ideas or materials. By clearly stating this policy, Kalo seeks to avoid any misunderstandings in the event that products we develop might seem to be similar to your own creative work.</p>
<p>Kalo does not pay for your ideas if you give them to us unsolicited. To that end, by accepting these Policies and Procedures, you acknowledge and agree that Kalo has and will have many products and projects in various stages of development, and that the result may be similar or identical to your own ideas for products or projects. You also agree that if you submit any creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, designs, original artwork, or other information (collectively, “Unsolicited Submissions”), you assign to Kalo all of your rights in and to them without compensation or payment of any kind<strong>. Unless otherwise specified in writing, this Unsolicited Submissions policy also applies to submissions made as part of any and all Kalo contests, promotions, or incentives.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Unsolicited Submissions and all contest, promotion, or incentive submissions shall be the property of Kalo. Kalo shall not be obligated to keep them confidential and may use or disclose them for any purpose&nbsp;without further permission from you and without any payment to you. If you have a product, business, creative idea, or creative artwork that you want to sell to Kalo, DO NOT SUBMIT that idea or artwork to Kalo without first obtaining a written non-disclosure agreement from the Kalo legal department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.4 - Advertising Templates and Approval</strong></p>
<p>You may only advertise or promote your Kalo businesses using approved tools, templates, or images acquired through Kalo, the Kalo Store or through the Team Office<sup>â</sup>. No approval is necessary to use these approved tools. If you wish to design your own online or offline marketing materials of any kind, your designs must be submitted to the Kalo Compliance Department <a href="mailto:compliance@finallyIntl.com">compliance@Kalo.com</a>) for approval. Unless you receive specific written approval from Kalo to use such self-developed tools, the request shall be deemed denied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.5 - Personal Specials and Corporate Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Consultants shall not advertise discounts, giveaways/raffles, and personal special pricing on any public forum. A public forum is defined as anywhere on social networking/media sites, including private pages as well as, online and offline classifieds sites or store bulletin boards. However, Consultants are allowed to advertise these specials on a private forum. A private forum is defined as personal emails, telephone calls, and other forms of one-to-one communication to current/existing customers. All advertising must be submitted to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a> for approval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consultants are allowed to advertise corporate pricing information on flyers, postcards, and ads in offline media. The only pricing information allowed on online media, including social networking sites, is published corporate pricing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering Kalo catalogs, brochures, or your own personal samples for free would not be considered a personal special and is therefore allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.6 - Altering Packaging, Labels, and Products Prohibited; Adding Personalized Stickers OK </strong></p>
<p>You may only sell Kalo products in their original packaging and may not repackage, relabel, or alter Kalo products, nor the labels on Kalo products you sell. Tampering with labels/packaging could be a violation of federal and state laws, and may result in civil liability in some circumstances. Kalo does allow you to affix a personalized sticker with your personal/contact information to each product or product container, as long as you do so without removing or obscuring the existing product labels. Altering a Kalo product in ways other than specified in Kalo instructions voids all product warranties and Kalo is no longer liable for any damages that result from altered or improperly used products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.7 - Don&rsquo;t Make False or Exaggerated Product Claims</strong></p>
<p>Consultants may not make claims about the therapeutic or curative properties of any products offered by Kalo, except those contained in official Kalo literature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.8 - International Sales</strong></p>
<p>You are only allowed to sell Kalo products or offer the Kalo opportunity within the United States, U.S. Territories, and those countries in which Kalo is operating, as announced in official Kalo literature. Consultants are not allowed to conduct business in any country or region until Kalo has officially launched operations in that country or region. Conducting business includes advertising, recruiting, or selling products. Signing the Consultant Agreement only authorizes the Consultant to work inside the United States and its territories. Additional documentation and agreements are necessary for U.S. Consultants to sell outside of the United States. International agreements and a list of open locations are located within the Documents tab on your Team Office<sup>â</sup> and must be accepted and transmitted before U.S. Consultants can sponsor and/or sell outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.9 - Media and Media Inquiries</strong></p>
<p>If a member of the press or media contacts you about Kalo or your Kalo business, you must contact Kalo at <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a> before you respond or disclose any information. If Kalo requests that you not respond to said press or media inquiry, or requests that you refer the press or media contact to the Company to respond, you agree that you will comply with such requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to proactively contact the media or distribute any form of press release that includes information about Kalo, its products, or the opportunity, you must first seek written approval from Kalo Compliance Department at <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.2.10 - Consultant Release</strong></p>
<p>By entering into the Consultant Agreement, you authorize Kalo to use your name, testimonials, and/or likeness in Kalo advertising or promotional materials with no remuneration. Additionally, you consent to and authorize the use and reproduction of any and all photographs or videos taken by or supplied to Kalo, and further consent to the use and reproduction of any quotes, testimonials, stories, or conversations on social networking media and/or the Kalo Forum for any print or electronic publicity, marketing, or promotional purposes, without remuneration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.3 - Non-Internet Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.3.1 - Print Advertisements, Personal Promotional Materials, and Sales Tools</strong></p>
<p>Print advertising, personal promotional materials, and sales tools must utilize Kalo-approved templates/images (see Section 6.2.4) or be acquired from Kalo or the Kalo Store. If you wish to design your own ad or marketing materials of any kind, your designs must be submitted to the Kalo Compliance Department <a href="mailto:compliance@finallyIntl.com">compliance@Kalo.com</a>) for consideration and inclusion in the template/image library. Unless you receive specific written approval from Kalo to use such self-developed tools, the request shall be deemed denied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go to the Resources tab on your Team Office<sup>â</sup> for guidelines and to access approved material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to distribute Kalo-approved personal promotional materials (flyers, brochures, etc.) at a business, public, or government facility (schools, libraries, etc.) you must first obtain permission from the business owner or senior-ranking office manager or administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.3.2 - Signage</strong></p>
<p>To avoid giving the appearance of a permanent retail establishment, yard signs and/or other signage must not be displayed on a stationary object or permanently installed outside, or affixed to the windows of, an Consultant&rsquo;s personal residence or other residence. Temporary signage or signage affixed to a mobile object may be displayed in conjunction with a home party, open house, or other approved Kalo event. The determination of whether an object is mobile or stationary shall be solely at Kalo&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.3.3 - Telemarketing</strong></p>
<p>You are not permitted to utilize telemarketing or to make automated calls/texts or to make “cold calls” to market Kalo products or the Kalo opportunity as there are federal and state laws against telemarketing through certain forms of communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4 - Online Advertising, Marketing, and Promotion</strong></p>
<p>It is your obligation to ensure your online marketing activities are truthful, are not deceptive, and do not mislead customers or potential Consultants in any way. Websites and Web promotion activities and tactics that mislead or are deceptive, regardless of intent, will not be allowed. Kalo will be the sole determinant of truthfulness and whether specific activities are misleading or deceptive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.1 - Domain Names, Email Addresses, and Online Aliases</strong></p>
<p>You are not allowed to use or register <em>Kalo</em>, any owned or affiliated brand names, such as <em>Kalo, or</em> Kalo LLC, or any of Kalo&rsquo;s trademarks, product names, or any derivatives, for any Internet domain name, email address, or online aliases. Additionally, you cannot use or register domain names, email addresses, and/or online aliases that could cause confusion, or be misleading or deceptive, in that they cause individuals to believe or assume the communication is from, or is the property of, Kalo. Examples of the improper use of Kalo are: <a href="mailto:scentsygal@msn.com"><em>Kalogal@msn.com</em></a><em>; </em><a href="http://www.scentsygroupisgreat.com/"><em>www.Kalogroupisgreat.com</em></a><em>; </em><a href="http://www.myspace.com/BranNew"><em>www.myspace.com/BranNew</em></a><em>; </em><a href="http://www.scentsy.com/official"><em>www.Kalo.com/official</em></a>, <a href="http://www.brannew.com/usa"><em>www.BranNew.com/usa</em></a>, <a href="http://www.scentsy.com/canada"><em>www.Kalo.com/canada</em></a>, etc., or having “Kalo”, “Kalo LLC”, or any other name or partial name used by Kalo.</p>
<p><strong>6.4.2 - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong></p>
<p>Core to Kalo&rsquo;s philosophy is the standard of “Building Beauty from Within” and practicing our core values of honesty, generosity and respect. Search engines are built to facilitate and expedite the online community finding the most recommended, relevant content available for any given topic. Authentic SEO is the result of adding genuine value to the online community through meaningful content you author, conversations you join, relationships you create, and improving the ease with which all of these are indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other SEO tactics that are not authentic, don&rsquo;t add value, don&rsquo;t contribute to the online community, and in any way attempt to manipulate search engine algorithms to overinflate the popularity and relevancy of your site are against policy. Given the complexity and ever-changing landscape of SEO it is impractical for us to list all SEO tactics that would be considered non-compliant. Improper SEO tactics include spam linking (or blog spam), unethical search engine optimization (SEO) tactics, misleading click-through ads (i.e., having the display URL of a PPC campaign appear to resolve to an official Kalo corporate site when it goes elsewhere), unapproved banner ads, and unauthorized press releases. If in Kalo&rsquo;s discretion, you are utilizing improper SEO tactics, it may take any action it determines are necessary to enforce this policy, including requiring you to cease any practices, take down any website or particular content, or terminating you as an Consultant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.2.1 - Kalo Hotlinks</strong></p>
<p>When directing readers to your registered external site or Personal Website, it must be evident from a combination of the link and the surrounding context to a reasonable reader that the link will be resolving to the site of an Independent Consultant. Attempts to mislead Web traffic into believing they are going to an official Kalo corporate site, when in fact they <em>land</em> at an Consultant site (personal or registered external), will not be allowed. The determination as to what is <em>misleading</em> or what constitutes a <em>reasonable reader </em>will be at Kalo&rsquo;s sole discretion. Redirecting a reader from another Consultant&rsquo;s external website or Personal Website to any other website other than the Consultant&rsquo;s Personal Website is prohibited by Kalo policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.2.2 - Spam Linking</strong></p>
<p>Spam linking is defined as multiple consecutive submissions of the same or similar content into emails, blogs, wikis, guest books, websites, or other publically accessible online discussion boards or forums and is not allowed. This includes blog spamming, blog comment spamming, and/or “spamdexing.” Any comments you make on blogs, forums, guest books, etc., must be unique, informative, and relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.3 - Approved Consultant Websites</strong></p>
<p>The term <em>Personal Website</em> refers to the external-facing Consultant website offered by Kalo to you for a monthly fee. The term <em>registered external website</em> refers to your own Kalo-approved external website (if you have one), or other Kalo-approved Web presence that is hosted on non-Kalo servers and has no official affiliation with Kalo. You are not allowed to monetize your Personal Website or your registered external website through affiliate programs, Google AdSense, or similar third-party programs that provide functionality or software as a service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4 - Internet Advertising / Awareness Generation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.1 - Online Classifieds</strong></p>
<p>You may not use online classifieds (including, without limitation, Craigslist, eBay or Amazon) to list, sell, or retail specific Kalo products or product bundles. You may use online classifieds (including Craigslist) for prospecting, recruiting, sponsoring, and informing the public about the Kalo business opportunity and/or your Kalo events, provided Kalo-approved templates/images are used. Multiple Kalo brands may be listed and promoted together as long as the advertisement has been approved by <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. These templates will identify you as an Independent Consultant. If a link or URL is provided, it must link to your Personal Website as provided by Kalo or your registered external website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.2 - eBay / Online Auctions</strong></p>
<p>You may not list or sell Kalo products on eBay or other online auctions, nor may you enlist or knowingly allow a third party (customer) to sell Kalo products on eBay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.3 - Online Retailing</strong></p>
<p>You may not list or sell Kalo products on any online retail store or e-commerce site, nor may you enlist or knowingly allow a third party (customer) to sell Kalo products on any online retail store or e-commerce site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.4 - Banner Advertising</strong></p>
<p>You may place banner advertisements on a website provided you use Kalo-approved templates and images. All banner advertisements must link to your Personal Website or a registered external website. You may not use <em>blind</em> ads or web pages that make product or income claims that are ultimately consultantd with Kalo products or the Kalo opportunity. Multiple Kalo brands may be advertised in the same banner advertisement as long as it has been approved by <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.5 - Unsolicited Spamming </strong></p>
<p>You are not allowed to transmit mass, unsolicited emails, faxes, texts, direct mail, or phone calls to promote Kalo, its products, or the Kalo opportunity to people you do not know, or who have not given you permission to contact them regarding Kalo. People who are “opt in” subscribers, who have initiated a request to be included in bulk emailing, newsletter, or other standardized communications from you, are allowed. The use of deceptive subject lines and/or false header information or any other fraudulent tactics is prohibited. The making of unauthorized claims is also prohibited, as more fully described in Section 6.2.7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.6 - Social Networking Sites (Facebook / Twitter / LinkedIn / Pinterest, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>You may use personal social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, blogs, forums, and other social shared interest sites) to share information about any Kalo brand product or business opportunity and for recruiting and sponsoring. You may also create a social presence dedicated to growing your business but these sites may not be used to sell or offer to sell specific Kalo products where the transaction takes place on that platform, and your use of these sites must comply with the following guidelines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>You are not allowed to use or register Kalo or any of Kalo&rsquo;s trademarks, product names, or any derivatives for any Internet domain name, email address, or online aliases. The name of your account must not state either the term “Kalo” or use any other trademarked terms of Kalo. This includes product names, incentive trip names, leadership retreats, any other corporate events hosted by Kalo, promotional campaign, or any other programs. If the term “Kalo” is used, it must state in full “Independent Consultant.”</li>
<li>These sites may not be used for e-commerce through the social media platform. All transactions must take place through your Personal Website (PWS). In addition, Consultants are only allowed to post corporate pricing, not their own special pricing.</li>
<li>Profiles you generate in any social platform where you mention or discuss Kalo must clearly identify you as an Independent Consultant.</li>
<li>Your participation on any social media platform must avoid inappropriate conversations, comments, images, video, audio, applications, or any other adult, profane, discriminatory, or vulgar content. Do not post any comments, photos, or videos that are rude or offensive to another Consultant.</li>
<li>Unprofessional or disrespectful online conduct toward Kalo competitors is strictly prohibited. You may not disparage any Kalo competitor, their customers, or their products on a social media platform such as Facebook or Twitter.</li>
<li>Consultants shall not post their URL or solicit their Kalo business on any corporate Kalo social media presence page (i.e. Facebook pages, YouTube page, Twitter, etc.) or any social media presence benefiting from any Kalo Charitable Products. Any solicitation posts on a corporate social media page will be deleted and the user may be banned from the page.</li>
<li>Banner ads and images used on these sites must be current and must come from the Kalo approved library. Multiple Kalo brands may be combined in one banner ad if submitted and approved through <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</li>
<li>If a link is provided, it must link to your Personal Website or a registered external website.</li>
<li>Multiple Kalo brands may be mentioned on a single Facebook page or separate Kalo brand pages may be created. The determination of what is inappropriate is at Kalo&rsquo;s sole discretion, and offending Consultants will be subject to disciplinary action and/or cancellation.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.7 - Digital Media Submission (YouTube, iTunes, Pinterest, PhotoBucket, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>You may upload, submit, or publish any Kalo-related video, audio, or photo content that you develop and create as long as it aligns with Kalo values, contributes to the Kalo community greater good, and is in compliance with Kalo Policies and Procedures. These submissions must clearly identify you as an Independent Consultant (either in the content itself and/or in the content description tag), must comply with all copyright/legal requirements, and must state that you are solely responsible for this content and not Kalo. You may not upload, submit, or publish any content (video, audio, presentations, or any computer files) received from Kalo or captured at official Kalo events or in buildings owned or operated by Kalo without prior written permission from <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. This would include any presentations by speakers or Kalo corporate employees given in an auditorium or break-out meeting sessions at a Kalo event.</p>
<p><strong>6.4.4.8 - Sponsored Links / Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Ads</strong></p>
<p>Sponsored links or pay-per-click ads (PPC) are acceptable. The destination URL must be to either your Personal Website or to a registered external website. The display URL must also be to either your Personal Website or to your registered external site, and must not portray any URL that could lead the user to assume they are being led to a Kalo corporate site, or be inappropriate or misleading in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5 - Consultant Websites</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.1 - Kalo Consultant Personal Websites (PWS)</strong></p>
<p>When you sign up as a Kalo Consultant you receive a Personal Website subscription to facilitate the easiest online buying experience for your customers. This subscription is renewed each year from your date of enrollment when your annual registration fee is paid. You are solely responsible and liable for the content that you add to your Personal Website and must regularly review the content every thirty (30) days to ensure it is accurate and relevant. You may not alter the branding of your Personal Website, and you may not use your Personal Website, including links to other websites, to promote, market, or sell non-Kalo products, services, or business opportunities. Specifically, you may not alter the look (placement, sizing etc.) or functionality of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consultant logo</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your name</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalo corporate website redirect button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because your Personal Website resides on an appropriate country-specific Kalo domain, Kalo reserves the right to receive analytics and information regarding the usage of your website. By default, your Kalo Personal Website URL may be in the form of one or more formats (i.e. &lt;<em>Consultant ID #</em>&gt;. Kalo.&lt;<em>country extension</em>&gt; or Kalo.&lt;country extension&gt;/&lt;your Username&gt;. If you choose to change this default ID, you must choose a uniquely identifiable website name that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Does not use the word “Kalo”, “Kalo LLC”, or any other brand name as used by Kalo, in any form;</li>
<li>Cannot be confused with other portions of the Kalo corporate websites;</li>
<li>Will not confuse a reasonable person into thinking they have landed on a Kalo corporate page;</li>
<li>Cannot be confused with any Kalo team name;</li>
<li>Does not contain any discourteous, misleading, or off-color word that distracts from Kalo&rsquo;s image; or</li>
<li>Cannot identify or be confused with a geographical location, region, state name, or country.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>State/province names, country names, or abbreviations of these geographical names when used in isolation are not allowed (for example: <em>Alberta.Kalo.ca, usa.Kalo.us, or id.Kalo.us</em>). However, if the geographical name is used with an identifier then it is allowable (for example: <em>janesalberta.Kalo.ca, texassmellsgood.Kalo.us</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>URL extensions in use before a Leader registers his/her team name may remain, but extensions put into use after a team name is registered will be removed. Examples of inappropriate naming conventions are: <em>/info</em>; <em>/official</em>; <em>/buy</em>; <em>/search</em>; <em>/product names; /hometeam; /teamfabulous</em>; /#&amp;@%; <em>/Kalo gal; /Kalo king</em>. If you have any questions about selecting a URL, contact <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2 - External Websites (Non-Personal Websites)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are allowed one (1) external website dedicated exclusively to Kalo brands (not including a team website you may develop; see Section 6.4.5.3) to personalize your Kalo business and promote the Kalo opportunity. If you wish to develop an external website, you must do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Subscribe to a Personal Website;</li>
<li>Register your external website with Kalo by going to the Account tab of your Team Office<sup>â</sup>;</li>
<li>Adhere to the branding and image usage policies described in this document;</li>
<li>Agree to modify your website to comply with current or future Kalo policies;</li>
<li>Agree to redirect or forward your external website to a Kalo corporate home page in the event of the voluntary or involuntary cancellation of your Consultant Agreement.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blog or website developed on a blogging platform that is developed for the primary purpose of marketing or promoting Kalo products and/or the Kalo opportunity is considered an external website and must be registered with Kalo. Blogs, created by you or others, that are developed primarily for other purposes that mention Kalo brands and direct traffic to your website(s) do not need to be registered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per Section 11.5.2, you may not receive any monetary compensation or exchange for goods and services from any Kalo Consultant to build, host, or maintain their websites, or for supporting the Consultant with any service or function provided by Kalo, but you are allowed to voluntarily help other Kalo Consultants should you choose to do so. You are not allowed to manage or have ready access to the database or site administration of any sites you build for your team. Any exploitive actions on websites or any other service provided by Kalo for team members are prohibited and seen as a violation of these policies and procedures. All assets, video, pictures, graphics, plug-ins, etc., used on a site you build for your downline or any other Consultant must be housed on the domain owned by that Consultant, not a domain that you own. If you set up any kind of tracking for an Consultant you may not have access to that information. Absolutely no links on any site you build for an Consultant should link to either your Personal Website or external authorized site. Also, you cannot use the site to promote, market, or link to your Web development business website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.1 - External Website Content </strong></p>
<p>You are solely responsible and liable for your own website content, messaging, claims, and information and must ensure your website appropriately represents and enhances the Kalo brands and adheres to Kalo guidelines and policies. Additionally, your website must not contain disingenuous pop-up ads or promotions or malicious code. Decisions and corrective actions in this area are at Kalo&rsquo;s sole discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.2 - Consultant Image Mandate</strong></p>
<p>To avoid confusion, the following three (3) elements must be prominently displayed at the top of every page of your registered external website:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Independent Consultant logo</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your name and title</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your contact information</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kalo corporate website redirect button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Kalo brand themes and images are desirable for consistency, anyone landing on your page needs to clearly understand that they are at an Independent Consultant site and not a Kalo corporate page. Please refer to Kalo Consultant Website Guidelines in your back office for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.3 - External Sites Must Exclusively Promote a Kalo Brand</strong></p>
<p>Your Kalo external website must contain content and information that is exclusive to Kalo. You may not advertise other products or services other than the Kalo product line and the Kalo opportunity. For example, you may not create an <em>Internet Health and Beauty store</em> where brands other than Kalo are offered.&nbsp; You may mention other Kalo brands on your registered external website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.4 - No E-commerce or Stock-and-Sell Retailing </strong></p>
<p>Your registered external website must only facilitate the entry into your consultantd Kalo Personal Website. You may not <em>stock and sell </em>Kalo products, nor may you facilitate an e-commerce environment that would facilitate this model. All orders must be placed through your official Personal Website or ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.5 - External Website Termination</strong></p>
<p>In the event of the voluntary or involuntary cancellation of your Consultant Agreement, you are required to remove your registered external website from public view within ten (10) days and redirect (forward) all traffic from that domain to <a href="http://www.finallyintl.com/">www.Kalo.com</a>. Your external website may be transferred to another Kalo Consultant, subject to Kalo&nbsp;approval, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.6 - External Website Links</strong></p>
<p>Your external website can only link to pages within your approved external site, one (1) Kalo Personal Website, or to your social networking sites that you use to promote your Kalo business (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.). You cannot monetize your external Kalo website by having outbound links, affiliate programs, Google AdSense, or other similar tactics.</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.2.7 - External Website Naming</strong></p>
<p>Your external website cannot identify a state/province name, country names, or abbreviations of these geographical names when used in isolation (for example: BC<em>.Kalo.ca, USA.Kalo.us, or CA.Kalo.us</em>). However, if the geographical name is used with an identifier then it is allowable (for example: karenBC<em>.Kalo.ca or StewartFamily.Kalo.us</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, you must choose a uniquely identifiable website name/URL that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Does not use the words “Kalo”, or “Kalo LLC” in any form;</li>
<li>Cannot be confused with other portions of the Kalo corporate websites;</li>
<li>Will not confuse a reasonable person into thinking they have landed on a Kalo corporate page;</li>
<li>Cannot be confused with any Kalo team name;</li>
<li>Does not contain any discourteous, misleading, or off-color word that distracts from Kalo&rsquo;s image;</li>
<li>Cannot identify or be confused with a geographical location, region, state name, or country.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.4.5.3 - External Team Websites / Groups / Communities</strong></p>
<p>You may use one (1) approved team website for the purposes of connecting, communicating, training, educating, and sharing best practices among team members. Because these sites may contain sensitive and Company-specific information, these team websites must be password-protected. A team website must not be used to promote your team and cannot have links to your PWS, Team Office or external site. You cannot use your team name in the URL of your PWS or external site. You may build a team website on social media platforms so long as it complies with the guidelines in Section 6.4.4.6 and it must be private with the activity of the group not represented outside the group. All team websites must be registered with Kalo. Because team websites must be password protected, please be sure to provide a user name and password so that Kalo may review the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Team sites are not to be used as a form of marketing for you or your team. The following is a list of steps that you or your site builder need to take in order to prevent your team website from garnering page rank and showing up in search engine results:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Do not submit sitemaps to search engines.</li>
<li>Add meta code to your site, so that search engines are prevented from indexing your site.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t add other meta data such as meta descriptions, titles, or tags to the code of the site. If you have any such meta data on your site you&rsquo;ll need to remove it.</li>
<li>Publish a robots.txt file to the site with a disallow tag so crawlers won&rsquo;t visit any pages on the site.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.5 - Commercial Outlets and Trade Shows</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.5.1 - Commercial Outlets / Retail Stores</strong></p>
<p>You are not allowed to offer Kalo products for sale in any permanent retail or service business establishment. A promotional display may be exhibited for the generation of leads or the collection of orders in conjunction with a Kalo Event. This display shall consist of no more than one (1) sample of each type of product category plus any promotional materials acquired from Kalo, Kalo on-line store, or downloaded from the approved template/image library. Such displays may be in or near retail locations, provided that you comply with all applicable laws and have permission from the property owner. Cash-and-carry sales from a retail establishment are strictly prohibited. Signs, banners, and other advertising outside retail locations announcing or directing shoppers to a Kalo display inside a retail environment are prohibited. In addition, you may not sell on the sidewalk of a retail establishment or in the parking lot of a retail establishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customer orders cannot be delivered to customers at any retail location. Deliveries to customers must be made outside of and away from retail environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.5.2 - Reselling</strong></p>
<p>You cannot knowingly sell to anyone who is going to resell Kalo products in retail environments, online, through fairs and shows, or through any other reselling/retailing venue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.5.3 - Cooperative Advertising and Promotion with Retail Entities</strong></p>
<p>Kalo products and/or the Kalo opportunity may not be offered in an online or offline advertisement or promotion (including in-store product giveaways) with any retail store, business, or entity. Cooperative promotions with service entities (e.g. a dentist&rsquo;s or doctor&rsquo;s office) are allowed pending prior approval from Kalo (<a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>). These cooperative promotions may combine multiple Kalo brands if approved through <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.5.4 - Fairs, Expositions and Other Temporary Sales Forums</strong></p>
<p>Kalo allows you to sell products on a cash-and-carry basis at temporary sales forums, as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>A Kalo Consultant should represent and/or sell all Kalo Brands at an event;</li>
<li>Booths must be attended at all times by a Kalo Consultant in good standing;</li>
<li>If an Consultant contracts for a non-Kalo booth at the same show, the two booths cannot be adjacent to one another;</li>
<li>Booths representing different Kalo brands cannot be adjacent to one another (reasonable efforts);</li>
<li>Consultants cannot contract or participate in an event for more than 24 days in a calendar year - regardless of whether these days are consecutive or not (e.g., an Consultant can participate in the entire 24-day Texas State Fair, a one-day-a-week Farmers Market for 24 weeks each calendar year, etc.);</li>
<li>Consultants may not enter into contracts for two or more events that have overlapping days;</li>
<li>Any displayed or advertised prices must be full retail (catalog pricing). Unpublished discounts can only be offered to customers on an individual, verbal basis;</li>
<li>The booth must be a ‘rentable&rsquo; space at a temporary event not organized by any Kalo Consultant without prior written approval;</li>
<li>If a temporary event is taking place within a retail/service establishment (e.g., a mall), in addition to the preceding conditions, the event must be managed by, and the agreement entered into must be with, an event management company and not the retail establishment owner, agent and/or management company (e.g., a mall kiosk for the purpose of selling product cash-and-carry would not be allowed, regardless of the duration);</li>
<li>Only current Kalo Consultants in good standing are authorized to contract for booth space at a show or event. The contract is between <em>you as an Consultant</em> and the <em>Event Sponsor</em>. Kalo is not, and may not be made, a party to a contract between you and an event organizer, nor will Kalo be liable for any disputes that arise between you and an event organizer or between you and another Kalo Consultant.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the majority of events would be best served by having a single Kalo Consultant representing all brands at an event, the number of Kalo brand booths allowed at an event will be determined between the Kalo Consultant(s) and event management, and not by Kalo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.5.4.4 - International Fairs and Shows Policy</strong><br> Only Kalo Consultants who have signed a Country-Specific Distribution and/or Sponsorship Agreement AND who are RESIDENTS of that country (regardless of their citizenship) and are in good standing with Kalo Intl., are allowed to enter into agreements and/or contracts with a fair, show, or other temporary sales event in that country.&nbsp; You may not take products across international borders with the intention of selling them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 7 - OPERATING YOUR KALO BUSINESS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.1 - Product Sales</strong></p>
<p>To be eligible for bonuses, commissions, and advancement, you must meet the Personal Volume (PV), Group Volume (GV), and Team Volume (TV) requirements consultantd with your rank in the Compensation Plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.2 - Sales Receipts</strong></p>
<p>You are required to provide your retail customers with two (2) copies of an official Kalo sales receipt at the time of the sale and you must retain these sales receipts, and make them available to Kalo upon request, for a period of two (2) years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3 - Ordering and Shipping</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.1 - Placing Orders </strong></p>
<p>You must place orders through your Consultant Team Office<sup>â</sup>. Individual customers may also place orders through your Personal Website. Kalo does not allow customers to place orders directly through the corporate website.</p>
<p><strong>7.3.1.1 - Party Orders</strong></p>
<p>Customer orders gathered at a Kalo party (if applicable) must be placed through your Team Office<sup>â</sup> or through your Personal Website. These party orders will be shipped to you or your customer.&nbsp; If sent to you then products must be delivered to customers within five (5) days of you receiving them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.1.2 - Individual Customer Orders</strong></p>
<p>Customers may order Kalo products from you through your Personal Website if you choose to have one, or these orders may be placed by you through your ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.2 - Shipping</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.2.1 - Shipping Costs</strong></p>
<p>Shipping cost may be posted in the Team Office<sup>â</sup> and may be subject to changes.&nbsp; All shipping costs will display at time of order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.2.2 - APO/FPO Addresses</strong></p>
<p>In compliance with Department of Defense regulations, Kalo will ship orders to certain APO/FPO addresses through the Military Postal Service (MPS). Kalo will not deliver to all zip codes, due to limitations with climate and transportation logistics. The list of approved ship-to APO/FPO zip codes may be posted to the Resources tab in your Team Office<sup>â</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific restrictions and requirements apply with APO/FPO shipments: items shipped through the MPS may not be resold, and MPS addresses may not be set as the default address when prohibited. The improper use of the MPS defrauds U.S. taxpayers, is financially prohibitive for the company, and could result in the loss of MPS privileges to all service members within a country. All Consultants are responsible for complying with MPS regulations at all times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.2.3 - Shipping Times and Back Orders</strong></p>
<p>Kalo will make every effort to ship products within ten (10) business days from the date an order is received. If items are not in stock, they will be placed on back order and shipped when Kalo receives them. These back-ordered items will be noted in your Team Office<sup>â</sup> as <em>Shipped Partial</em> in the <em>Status</em> column. If back-ordered items are not expected to ship within thirty (30) days, Kalo will notify you and/or your customer. You will be charged for and receive PV on back-ordered items unless the product has been discontinued. Alternatively, you may cancel back-ordered items and request a refund, receive a credit to your account, or request replacement merchandise. If a refund or credit on your account is requested, your PV will be decreased by that amount in the same month the refund or credit is issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.2.4 - What Should You Do When a Kalo Shipment Arrives</strong>?</p>
<p>When you receive a shipment from Kalo, it is your obligation to conduct an inventory and confirm that the product received matches the product listed on the shipping invoice and is free of damage. Failure to notify Kalo of any shipping discrepancy or damage within ten (10) business days of confirmed delivery of shipment will cancel your right to request a correction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.3.3 - Holding or Manipulating the Timing of Orders</strong></p>
<p>You may not hold or manipulate the timing of product purchases. All orders must be submitted to Kalo within five (5) days from the date the order was given to the Consultant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.4 - Sponsoring </strong></p>
<p>Consultants have the right to sponsor and enroll others into Kalo by helping them successfully complete an Consultant Application and Agreement as outlined in Section 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.4.1 - No Change of Sponsor</strong></p>
<p>To protect the integrity of all downline organizations, Kalo does not allow voluntary changes in sponsorship except under exceptional circumstances. Please consider carefully before enrolling. Other regulations pertaining to Sponsor changes can be found in Section 13. Kalo reserves the right to charge a reasonable cost to the Consultant for changing sponsorship related to any of the circumstances listed in this section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.4.2 - Responsibilities of a Sponsor</strong></p>
<p>If, in the opinion of Kalo, you are failing to train, recognize, inform, and/or motivate a frontline Consultant, or you fail to comply with any applicable Policy, Kalo may, at its sole discretion, opt to suspend your account or freeze your commissions until a resolution can be achieved. For more information on your responsibilities as a Sponsor, see Section 5.3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.4.3 - Can a Minor Enroll in Kalo?</strong></p>
<p>You may not recruit or enroll a person who is recognized as a minor in his or her state of residence. It is your responsibility to know the age of majority (or adulthood) in the states in which you sponsor other Consultants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.4.4 - Marketing the Business Opportunity: Limitation on Recruiting Efforts</strong></p>
<p>You may not offer any monetary inducement to encourage others to join your Kalo team. This includes, but is not limited to, offers to pay for new recruits&rsquo; Starter Kits, offers of free product or gifts, and offers to provide incentives if new recruits reach milestones within a certain time period. The initial transaction to become a Kalo Consultant (i.e., purchasing a Starter Kit) must be a stand-alone transaction between Kalo and the prospective Consultant and cannot be linked to any future performance, milestones, or promises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.5 - One Kalo Business per Consultant and per Household</strong></p>
<p>As an Consultant you are allowed to operate, own, have an interest in, or receive compensation from only one (1) Kalo business (but can include as many Kalo brands as you&rsquo;d like). Furthermore, individuals from the same unit (husbands and wives or common-law couples — collectively <em>spouses — </em>and dependent children living in the same household) may not have an interest in more than one (1) Kalo business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If spouses choose to operate a Kalo business, they must be jointly sponsored as one (1) Kalo business. Spouses, regardless of whether one (1) or both actually sign the Application and Agreement, may not own, operate, or participate in (either directly or indirectly) any other Kalo business. Spouses may jointly operate one (1) Kalo business without submitting a Business Entity Form. All other business partnerships must submit a Business Entity Form (see Section 5.2.1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only exceptions Kalo will consider to this policy are a) if two (2) existing Kalo Consultants marry, or b) in the case of an Consultant receiving an interest in another Kalo business through inheritance. Exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.5.1 - Actions of Household Members or Affiliated Individuals</strong></p>
<p>If a member of your immediate household engages in activities that violate the Agreement (including these Policies), you will be considered to be in violation of the Agreement, and Kalo may take disciplinary action against you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case of a Kalo Business Entity, if any individual consultantd with that entity violates the Agreement, these actions will be deemed a violation by the entity and Kalo may take disciplinary action against the entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.6 - Business Pursuit Insurance</strong></p>
<p>You may wish to secure insurance for your business. Neither your homeowner policy nor your automobile policy covers business-related injuries, or the theft of or damage to inventory or business equipment. Contact your insurance agent to make certain that your property is protected. This can often be accomplished with a <em>Business Pursuit</em> endorsement attached to your present homeowner and automobile policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.7 - Product Liability Coverage</strong></p>
<p>Kalo maintains insurance to protect the Company and Consultants against product liability claims. Kalo&rsquo;s insurance policy contains a <em>Vendors Endorsement,</em> which extends coverage to Consultants, as long as they are marketing Kalo products in accordance with Company Policies and applicable laws and regulations. Kalo&rsquo;s product liability policy <em>does not</em> extend coverage to claims or actions that arise as a result of an Consultant&rsquo;s misconduct in marketing the products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 8 - PAYMENT </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.1 - Insufficient Funds </strong></p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure there are sufficient funds or credit available in your account to cover orders you submit. If funds or credit are not available, the system may not accept your order. If your autoship order is declined and substitute payment is not received within the commission cycle, the autoship will not process and you will not receive volume credit for that commission cycle and may be declared inactive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.2 - Returned Checks</strong></p>
<p>In the event your bank returns a check for insufficient funds, Kalo may contact you to obtain a credit or debit card to cover the payment. A returned-check fee may be added to the order amount. Kalo reserves the right to require that future orders be paid by credit card, money order, or cashier&rsquo;s check. Any unresolved or outstanding balance owed to Kalo will be withheld from your bonus and commission payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.3 - Restrictions on Third Party Use of Credit Cards and Checking Account Access </strong></p>
<p>You are not allowed to permit other Consultants or customers to use your credit or debit card, or permit debits to your checking account(s) to enroll in or make purchases from Kalo without specific permission and guidance from Kalo.&nbsp; If permission is granted and Consultants do not follow the specific guidelines outlined then the Consultant is responsible for all charges related to the third party use of permissible payment methods.&nbsp; Using someone else&rsquo;s credit card without their express, written permission is prohibited and may be grounds for involuntarily cancellation of an Consultant account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8.4 - Sales Taxes</strong></p>
<p>The Kalo program has been designed to free you from as many administrative and operational tasks as possible. Currently, Kalo requires you to remit sales taxes, keep sales tax records, and file sales tax reports.&nbsp; You will be notified if Kalo changes its tax collection methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The taxability of products and sales tax rates differ by state; and local taxes (county, municipality, and other tax districts) further complicate the picture. This could result in a disparity between what Kalo charges you, and what you in turn charge your customer, depending on the location of the sale and where the order is shipped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be prepared to provide records of the date of sale, state, county, city, and rate of tax where shipped and total retail sales. It is your responsibility to know what products are taxable and at what rate based on where products are sold and/or shipped. If you have questions regarding taxability and rates, contact your state or local department of revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only instance where sales tax does not need to be collected is when the nonprofit organization purchases product for its own use as an enrolled Consultant and upon completing and submitting the proper tax exempt documentation to Kalo to be recognized as a tax exempt business.&nbsp; Consultants seeking tax exempt status should email their nonprofit&rsquo;s sales tax permit/resale certificate and any other documentation certifying their tax exempt status directly to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 9 - WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, RETURNS, AND REPURCHASES</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.1 - 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee</strong></p>
<p>Kalo offers a 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee to all customers for any reason. As an Consultant, you are bound to honor this guarantee. If a customer is dissatisfied with any Kalo product, the customer may return the product to you, within thirty (30) days of purchase, for a replacement or exchange. See Section 9.4 below for additional information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an Consultant, you are limited in the amount of product you can exchange solely for dissatisfaction to 100 PV points for each Kalo brand in a calendar year. If you wish to return such merchandise exceeding the above amounts set forth per brand, the return will be classified as an inventory repurchase and the Company shall repurchase the inventory pursuant to the terms of Section 9.3, and your Consultant Agreement shall be cancelled unless you have received prior written approval from Kalo. Please see Sections 9.4.1 and 9.4.2 below for specific return procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.3 - Return of Inventory and Sales Aids by Consultants</strong></p>
<p>If your Consultant Agreement is cancelled, you may return sales aids (including Kalo Store items) and inventory that you are unable to sell or use for a refund, as long as they are in resalable condition (see <em>Resalable </em>in Section 15 - Definitions). After Kalo receives the product and/or sales aids, and confirms that they are in resalable condition, you will be reimbursed 90 percent of the original purchase cost, less shipping charges, and less any commissions, bonuses, rebates, or other incentives you&rsquo;ve received and that are consultantd with the returned merchandise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.3.1 - Return / Refund Exception for Montana Residents</strong></p>
<p>Kalo currently does not accept Consultant or Preferred Customer enrollments for Montana.&nbsp; All other return or refund policies applying to retail customers may apply to retail purchases for any residents of Montana if not prohibited by Montana law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.4 - Procedures for Exchanges and Replacements</strong></p>
<p>Definitions:</p>

<p><em>Replacement: </em>a defective or damaged product being returned for warranty reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.4.1 - Customer Exchanges or Replacements</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.4.2 - Consultant Exchanges </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.4.3 - Consultant Replacements</strong></p>
<p>The following procedures apply to all replacements by an Consultant, whether the replacement is on behalf of their customer or for the Consultant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 10 - BONUSES AND COMMISSIONS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissions will be deposited in Consultants&rsquo; Pay Portals according to the schedule of payments as outlined in the Kalo Compensation Plan. New Consultants will receive information on how to set up their Pay Portal account within two (2) weeks from enrolling or as needed upon receiving commissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.1 - Commission Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>You must be an active Consultant and in compliance with the Agreement to qualify for bonuses and commissions. Kalo pays commissions, in accordance with the Compensation Plan and your personal sales activity. There is no minimum sales requirement to receive commission on your sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.2 - Bonus Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>Kalo pays leadership bonuses, in accordance with the Compensation Plan, on the commissionable volume of your downline organization. For you to qualify for these bonuses, you are required to produce at least 100 points per month in Personal Volume (PV).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to lead your downline organization and set a proper example in all aspects of running your Kalo business: personal sales and party promotion; sponsoring; downline training, development, and nurturing included but not limited to returning calls, emails, and requests from your downline organization; and the manner in which you run your business and conduct yourself. If it is deemed by Kalo that you are not fulfilling these responsibilities, you may lose your rights to receive commissions from sales generated through your downline organization, or, at its sole discretion, Kalo may opt to terminate your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.3 - Adjustment to Bonuses and Commissions for Returned Products</strong></p>
<p>As an Consultant, you receive bonuses and commissions based on the actual sales of products to customers sold by your downline organization. If a product sold by someone in your downline organization is returned to Kalo for a refund, the bonuses and commissions you earned on that sale will be deducted from your earnings in the month the refund is given (and if necessary, continuing every month thereafter until the commission is recovered). If you cancel your Consultant Agreement with a balance still being owed to Kalo, that outstanding balance will be deducted from any monies owed to you upon your cancellation as described in Section 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.4 - Unclaimed Product Credits and Commissions</strong></p>
<p>If your Consultant Agreement is cancelled for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), any product credits you have in your account will be forfeited. Unclaimed commissions will be forfeited after 60 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10.5 - Online Activity Reports</strong></p>
<p>While Kalo earnestly strives to ensure all information provided to you by the Company in online reports is accurate and reliable, due to variables and factors beyond Kalo&rsquo;s control, Kalo, or anyone creating or transmitting the information, does NOT guarantee the information to be wholly accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All sales volume information is provided <em>as is</em> without warranties, express or implied, or representations of any kind whatsoever. In particular, but without limitation, there shall be no warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use, or non-infringement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, Kalo and/or other persons creating or transmitting the information will in no event be liable to any Consultant or anyone else for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages that arise out of the use of or access to sales volume information (including but not limited to lost profits, bonuses, or commissions, loss of opportunity, and damages that may result from inaccuracy, incompleteness, inconvenience, delay, or loss of the use of the information), even if Kalo or other persons creating or transmitting the information shall have been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Kalo or other persons creating or transmitting the information shall have no responsibility or liability to you or anyone else under any tort, contract, negligence, strict liability, products liability, or other theory with respect to any subject matter of this agreement or terms and conditions related thereto. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 11 - PROHIBITED CONSULTANT ACTIVITIES</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.1 - Bonus Buying</strong></p>
<p>Bonus-buying activities are fraudulent and constitute a material breach of your Consultant Agreement.</p>
<p>Bonus buying includes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>The enrollment or attempted enrollment of an individual or entity as an Consultant without their knowledge or consent.</li>
<li>The enrollment or attempted enrollment of non-existent individuals or entities as Consultants (this means you may not enroll a deceased or fictitious person or a fictitious business entity as an Consultant).</li>
<li>You may not use your credit card to enroll another Kalo Consultant under you or anyone else. You must be able to prove that anyone signing up as a recruit under you did so with full knowledge and understanding of the terms of the Consultant Agreement.</li>
<li>You may not offer to pay for all or any portion of a recruit&rsquo;s enrollment, nor may you offer gifts, incentives, or anything of monetary value in exchange for enrolling. Once a recruit has joined your team, you are free to offer them incentives to encourage behavior, but not before they enroll. Working with a Host to enroll, and then transferring the benefits they receive from the party to start-up Consultant benefits, is acceptable.</li>
<li>Orders on another Consultant&rsquo;s account outside of the permission of Kalo (regardless of who ends up with the product), in a manner that results in you qualifying for a rank advancement or achieving an incentive trip, reward, or recognition.</li>
<li>You must be able to demonstrate at least 70 percent of your total monthly Personal Volume (PV) is sold to customers outside your household, and/or have at least five (5) customers outside your household place orders each month. If you are building up inventory for a show or event, this is allowed as long as you can provide Kalo evidence of the show/event upon request.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kalo regularly audits rank advancements, promotions, and incentive trips to identify instances of bonus buying. Kalo must be vigilant in ensuring that orders are placed on behalf of Kalo customers through their Consultants. Failure to comply with any of the Bonus Buying policies listed above jeopardizes Kalo under federal regulations prohibiting pyramid schemes. If you participate in any of these activities, you are putting both your own Kalo business and others&rsquo; at risk!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.2 - Fraudulent Behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Consultants and others you work with are obligated to deal fairly and honestly with your customers. If an Consultant&rsquo;s interactions are dishonest or fraudulent in any way, including but not limited to accepting customer payment but failing to place or deliver orders, they will be immediately suspended. In such situations, Kalo&rsquo;s top priority is to work promptly with the suspended Consultant&rsquo;s upline leader, others involved, and/or the customer directly, to quickly fulfill customer orders and commitments. Once all customers are made whole, Kalo will turn its attention to investigating the fraudulent behavior and recovering its losses. If the investigation confirms fraudulent behavior, the suspended Consultant&rsquo;s Agreement with Kalo will be permanently cancelled and all pending compensation checks will be held and the value of the replaced product(s), as well as applicable shipping and service charges will be deducted. Where appropriate, these individuals will be turned over to legal authorities. If you become aware of fraudulent behavior, please contact Kalo at <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.3 - Inventory Purchases</strong></p>
<p>The Kalo program is designed so that you do not need to invest in and stock inventory for resale purposes. As such, you are prohibited from purchasing more than $1,000 per month in products, unless you can certify to Kalo that you have pending retail orders in excess of $1,000 or provide Kalo with other business reasons why such a purchase is necessary. This $1,000 limit is accumulated across all Kalo brands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.4 - Using Income Claims in Recruiting Efforts</strong></p>
<p>In your recruiting and sponsoring efforts, you may not make specific claims to demonstrate the earning potential of Kalo or party plan/direct selling opportunities by sharing your own earning information or sharing the earning information or testimonials of other Consultants. Not only can this activity be counterproductive, there are both federal and state laws that regulate, and even prohibit certain types of income claims and testimonials made by people engaged in direct selling.</p>
<p>When you are discussing the Kalo opportunity or Compensation Plan with a prospective Consultant, you may not make income projections or income claims or disclose information about your personal Kalo income. You may use hypothetical income examples to help each person understand how the Compensation Plan operates as long as 1) you make clear to the prospective Consultant(s) that the earnings example is purely hypothetical; and 2) you provide each prospective Consultant a copy of Kalo&rsquo;s official income disclosure statement. If Kalo has not published or made available an official income disclosure statement, you may not use hypothetical income examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.4.1 - Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You are fully responsible for all verbal and written statements made regarding Kalo products and/or the Compensation Plan that are not expressly contained in official Kalo materials. You agree to hold Kalo, Kalo leaders, officers, employees, and agents harmless from any liability as a result of any unauthorized representations or actions by you. This provision shall survive the termination of the Consultant Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5 - Conflicts of Interest </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5.1 - Participation in other Direct Selling Ventures</strong></p>
<p>Kalo Consultants, and members of their immediate household, may participate in other direct selling ventures (including party plan, network marketing, and other companies deemed direct sellers). However, they may not promote other companies or products together with Kalo products or brands (i.e. cross-market). For example, they may not conduct parties, place car advertisements, or have Kalo dedicated social networking accounts or web pages which advertise both a Kalo brand and a non-Kalo brand. If they have a personal social networking account that is not dedicated to the promotion of your Kalo business, it is within policy for them to mention Kalo alongside your other business ventures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5.2 - Consultants Selling to Other Consultants</strong></p>
<p>As a Kalo Consultant you, or members of your immediate household, are not allowed to sell any products or services to other Kalo Consultants when such products are related in any way to the conducting or maintaining of a Kalo business. This policy does not include the selling of authentic Kalo products. Additionally, you are not allowed to use Kalo information, events, websites, or assets to sell non-Kalo products to Kalo Consultants. If any disputes arise due to Consultants selling authentic Kalo products to one another, Kalo will not be involved in resolving the dispute and the Consultants realize that they choose to buy or trade from one another at their own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5.3 - No solicitation / Cross Promotion</strong></p>
<p>Subject to compliance with Section 11.5.1 above, Kalo Consultants, and members of their immediate household, may participate in other direct selling ventures (including party plan, network marketing, and companies deemed direct sellers); however, if they elect to participate in another such business, they are prohibited from Unauthorized Recruiting as described below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>They may not attempt to recruit or enroll Kalo Consultants for other direct selling business ventures directly or through a third party. This includes presenting or assisting in the presentation of other business opportunities, or implicitly or explicitly encouraging any Kalo Consultant to join other business ventures;</li>
<li>They may not offer literature, CDs/DVDs, promotional materials or product (or samples) from another direct selling business to Kalo Consultants;</li>
<li>They may not sell non-Kalo products or services to Kalo Consultants;</li>
<li>They may not offer Kalo products or promote the Kalo Compensation Plan in conjunction with any non-Kalo products, services, business plan, opportunity, or incentive.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5.4 - Online Reports and Information&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Kalo will make available to you through your ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup> information and reports (e.g., downline reports, order history reports, contact lists, etc.) needed to run and grow your Kalo business. All Team Office<sup>â</sup> information and reports are confidential and are classified as proprietary information and business trade secrets exclusively belonging to Kalo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information is made available to you in the strictest confidence and for the sole purpose of assisting you in working with your downline organizations in the development of your team and your business. When working with this information, you agree that you will not:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Directly or indirectly disclose any information contained in any online Kalo report to any individual, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity;</li>
<li>Directly or indirectly disclose, to any individual, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity, the password or other access code to your ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup>;</li>
<li>Use the information contained within your ConsultantTeam Office<sup>â</sup> or on a report to compete with Kalo or for any purpose other than promoting or supporting your Kalo business; or</li>
<li>Recruit or solicit any Kalo Consultant listed on any downline report for another direct selling venture, or in any manner attempt to influence or entice any Consultant to alter his or her business relationship with Kalo.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5.5 - Consultant Relationships with Employees</strong></p>
<p>No Consultant may reside in the same household nor be the spouse or domestic partner of a Kalo employee. For purposes of this Section, “same household” means people residing in the same dwelling, regardless of relation, and includes spouses or domestic partners even if the spouse/domestic partner resides at a different dwelling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.5.6 - Outside Employment</strong></p>
<p>A person who is a principal of another direct selling company, or a person with a member of his/her immediate household who is a principal of another direct selling company, shall not be permitted to be Consultants or to become Consultants.&nbsp;For the purposes of this section, “principal” shall mean any director, officer, executive, sole proprietor, general partner, or owner of 10 percent or more of any outstanding stock in any business entity that conducts sales through a direct sales channel, or controls or is under common control with any business entity that conducts sales through a direct sales channel.&nbsp;Kalo reserves the right to limit participation in Kalo events if Consultant or a member of his or her immediate household is an employee of another direct selling company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.6 - Targeting Other Direct Sellers</strong></p>
<p>Kalo does not condone consciously targeting the sales force of another direct sales company for recruiting purposes, nor does Kalo condone the solicitation of sales representatives from another direct sales company in ways that would cause these representatives to violate the terms of their contracts with their companies. Should you engage in these activities, you risk being sued by these other direct sales companies and if any lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation is brought against you, Kalo will not pay any of your defense costs or legal fees, nor will Kalo indemnify you for any judgment, award, or settlement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.7 - Cross Sponsoring </strong></p>
<p>Cross sponsoring occurs when an Consultant knowingly enrolls (or attempts to enroll) another Consultant or a former Consultant under him/her when that Consultant is enrolled in a different line of sponsorship, or the former Consultant was enrolled in a different line of sponsorship within the past six (6) months. This behavior is strictly prohibited. The use of any real or fictitious name, identification, or ID number in an effort to circumvent this policy is considered fraudulent behavior and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you are not allowed to demean, discredit, or defame other Kalo Consultants in an effort to entice another Consultant to become part of your downline organization.</p>
<p>If you discover cases of cross sponsoring, you must immediately report this activity to Kalo at <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>.&nbsp;When cross sponsoring occurs, it is Kalo&rsquo;s right to take disciplinary action against the offending Consultant, as well as any Consultants who encouraged or participated in cross sponsoring in any way.&nbsp;Kalo may also choose to restore or move all or part of the offending Consultant&rsquo;s downline back to his or her original downline organization at its sole discretion.&nbsp;Consultants involved in cross sponsoring waive all claims and causes of action against Kalo relating to the disposition of the cross-sponsored Consultant&rsquo;s downline organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.8 - Negative and Disparaging Remarks</strong></p>
<p>While Kalo welcomes constructive input from its Consultants, negative comments and remarks made by Consultants about Kalo, its products, or Compensation Plan, however, serve no purpose other than to sour the enthusiasm of other Kalo Consultants. For this reason, you must not disparage Kalo, other Kalo Consultants, Kalo&rsquo;s products, the Compensation Plan, or Kalo&rsquo;s board of directors, officers, or employees. If you disparage any of these parties, it is considered a material breach of your Consultant Agreement and you will be subject to disciplinary action. See Section 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.9 - Making Claims Regarding Government Approval or Endorsement</strong></p>
<p>Neither federal nor state regulatory agencies nor officials approve or endorse any specific direct selling or network marketing companies or programs. Therefore, you shall not represent or imply that Kalo or its Compensation Plan have been approved, endorsed, or otherwise sanctioned by any government agency or official.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.10 - Client Information</strong></p>
<p>Your client database is to be used solely for the purpose of running your Kalo business; it may not be sold, copied, and/or distributed to any person, Consultant, or company for any reason. Kalo may use your client database in connection with marketing and sales promotions related to your business, the Kalo opportunity, or other Kalo promotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.11 - Use of Nonpublic Information</strong></p>
<p>No Kalo Consultant may act on, or benefit in any way from, any information about Kalo, or its future plans, to pursue any aspect of the Consultant&rsquo;s business prior to the public announcement of such information by Kalo. Such information may include, but is not limited to, any information gained through relationship, conversation, or communication with Kalo employees, directors, or corporate officers, and includes all information that has not been publicly announced. Any actions taken prior to a public announcement will be deemed to be a violation of the Consultant Agreement and subject to disciplinary proceedings as defined in Section 12 of this agreement, including cancellation of your Consultant status. For further clarification, please see the definition of Public Announcement and Nonpublic Information in Section 15 of this document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 12 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12.1 - Disciplinary Sanctions</strong></p>
<p>If you are found in violation of your Consultant Agreement or these Policies and Procedures, or if Kalo determines that you have engaged in or are engaging in any illegal, fraudulent, deceptive, or unethical business conduct, you may be subject, at Kalo&rsquo;s discretion, to one or more of the following corrective measures:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>A written warning or admonition;</li>
<li>A requirement that you take immediate corrective measures;</li>
<li>Imposition of a fine, which may be withheld from bonus and commission payments;</li>
<li>Loss of rights to one or more bonus and/or commission payments;</li>
<li>Suspension of your Consultant Agreement for one or more pay periods;</li>
<li>The removal of a frontline Consultant and their downline organization from your downline organization;</li>
<li>Involuntary cancellation of your Consultant Agreement; or</li>
<li>Any other measure allowed within any portion of the Agreement, or which Kalo deems appropriate, to equitably resolve injuries caused wholly or in part by your policy violation or contractual breach.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kalo may withhold from you all or part of your bonuses and commissions while the Company is investigating any potential or alleged misconduct. If your Kalo business is cancelled for disciplinary reasons, you will not be entitled to any commission or bonus withheld during the investigation period. Kalo may institute legal proceedings for monetary and/or equitable relief at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12.3 - Grievances and Complaints</strong></p>
<p>If you have a grievance or complaint with another Consultant regarding any practice or conduct in relationship to Kalo or your Kalo business, you must first report the problem to your Sponsor, who is obligated to review the matter and make an earnest and meaningful attempt to resolve it with the other party&rsquo;s upline Sponsor and/or leader. If the matter cannot be resolved, it must be reported, in writing, to Compliance, who will review any facts and claims and will work to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12.4 - Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Agreement (including these Policies and Procedures), or any other claim or grievance against Kalo in any form whatsoever, including, but not limited to, economic losses, personal injury, or property damage, will be subject to mediation at Kalo&rsquo;s corporate address using a neutral mediator of Kalo&rsquo;s choosing. In the event that Kalo and the Consultant are unable to resolve their dispute through mediation, Kalo and the Consultant will be subject to final and binding arbitration to be held in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arbitration will take place before a panel of three (3) arbitrators to be selected as follows: the Consultant shall select one arbitrator, Kalo shall select one arbitrator, and the selected arbitrators will select the third arbitrator. The third arbitrator shall be an attorney. The party initiating the arbitration will identify its arbitrator in its written demand for arbitration to the other party. The other party shall identify its arbitrator within five (5) days of receipt of the notification of intent to arbitrate, and the third arbitrator must be selected within five (5) days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. Kalo shall pay the fees of its selected arbitrator, the Consultant shall pay the fees of his/her selected arbitrator, and Kalo and the Consultant shall pay equal shares of the third arbitrator&rsquo;s fees. The dispute will be subject to rules of arbitration agreed upon by the majority vote of the arbitrators and will be communicated to the party within ten (10) days after the arbitration panel has been completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prevailing party in any arbitration proceeding shall be entitled to receive from the losing party all costs and expenses of arbitration, including legal and filing fees. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties and may, if necessary, be reduced to a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final, and there shall be no right to appeal such decisions in any court or judicial system. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing in these Policies and Procedures shall prevent Kalo from applying to and obtaining from any court having jurisdiction a writ of attachment, a temporary injunction, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, or other relief available to safeguard and protect Kalo&rsquo;s interest prior to, during, or following the filing of any arbitration or other proceeding or pending the rendition of a decision or award in connection with any arbitration or other proceeding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, any dispute you have with Kalo for any act or omission relating to or arising from this Agreement, must be brought within one (1) year from the date of the alleged misconduct and by accepting this Agreement, you waive all claims that any other statute of limitation applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, by accepting this Agreement you agree and covenant not to file suit against Kalo, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, or employees for any claim or grievance you may have arising from your status as an Consultant of Kalo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12.5 - Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue</strong></p>
<p>Jurisdiction and venue of any matter not subject to arbitration shall reside in Salt Lake County, in the state of Utah unless the laws of the state in which you reside expressly require the application of its laws, in which case that state&rsquo;s law shall govern all issues related to jurisdiction and venue. The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern all matters relating to arbitration. The laws of the State of Utah shall govern all other matters relating to or arising from the Agreement unless the laws of the state in which an Consultant resides expressly require the application of its laws.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SECTION 13 - DOWNLINE LOSS, ACCOUNT CANCELLATIONS, RESTORATIONS, AND REINSTATMENTS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.1 - Effects of Voluntary or Involuntary Cancellation</strong></p>
<p>As long as you remain current and comply with the terms of the Consultant Agreement and these Policies and Procedures, Kalo will pay you bonuses and commissions in accordance with the Compensation Plan. Your bonuses and commissions constitute the entire reward for your efforts in generating sales and all activities related to generating sales — including building and nurturing your downline organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Consultant Agreement is voluntarily or involuntarily cancelled, you will receive bonuses and commissions only for the last full pay period prior to the cancellation (less any amounts withheld during an investigation preceding an involuntary cancellation). Upon the cancellation of your Consultant Agreement, you shall be deemed to have waived all of your rights, title, claim, or interest to the downline organization that you operated, and to any leadership bonuses from the sales generated by that organization. Additionally, you will lose the right to represent Kalo, the right to sell Kalo products, and the right to receive future commissions, bonuses, or other income resulting from Kalo activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.2 - Loss of Downline Resulting From Request by a Frontline Consultant Because a Sponsor Is Participating in Another Direct Selling Company</strong></p>
<p>Because of actual or potential conflicts of interest and the difficulties in avoiding cross promotion (see Section 11.5.3), Kalo may grant the request of an Consultant&rsquo;s front-line who seeks to “roll-up” to that Consultant&rsquo;s immediate upline when the company confirms that 1) the Consultant, or member of her/his immediate household, alleged to be with another direct selling company is in fact participating in that company, and 2) the Consultant, or member of her/his immediate household, has caused damage to the frontline Consultant due to the relationship with the other direct selling company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.3 - Voluntary Suspension</strong></p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t meet Kalo&rsquo;s minimum sales requirements for an extended period of time due to pregnancy, adoption, personal illness, care of a family member or natural disaster, you may upon approval by Kalo to voluntarily suspend your Agreement for up to three (3) calendar months by contacting Kalo&rsquo;s Compliance Department at <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a> to initiate the account suspension. You lose all Consultant benefits and privileges during the suspension and no activity can occur (i.e., no orders; no commissions; no trips earned, etc.) during the voluntary suspension, but your downline, earned volume and title stays intact. Your status will revert to normal at the end of the third calendar month unless you reengage sooner by contacting Kalo Consultant Services <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. You may use this benefit not more than once in every twenty-four (24) months and will be required to provide any requested documentation Kalo asks in order to determine approval of the voluntary suspension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are impacted by foreign military service assignments, please contact Consultant Support, and your position with Kalo can be held until your service is complete.</p>

All restoration requests must be submitted to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a> <a href="mailto:compliance@finallyIntl.com"></a>.&nbsp;In all other circumstances, former Kalo accounts may only be reinstated in accordance with provisions of Section 13.7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.5 - Involuntary Cancellation </strong></p>
<p>Your violation of any of the terms of the Agreement, including any amendments that may be made by Kalo at its sole discretion, may result in any of the sanctions listed in Section 12.1, including the involuntary cancellation of your Consultant Agreement. Cancellation shall be effective on the date on which written notice is mailed, return receipt requested, to your last known address, or when you receive actual notice of cancellation, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kalo expressly reserves the right to cancel all Consultant Agreements upon written notice in the event that it elects to: (1) cease business operations; (2) dissolve as a corporate entity; or (3) terminate distribution of its products via direct selling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.6 - Voluntary Cancellation </strong></p>
<p>You have a right to cancel your Consultant Agreement at any time, regardless of reason. Cancellation can be submitted to <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>,or be sent to the corporate offices by mail/fax.&nbsp; Your notice must include your name, address, Consultant ID number, signature and the current date. Emailed cancellations must come from the email listed on the Consultant&rsquo;s main account and count as an electronic signature.&nbsp; All Consultants Agreement cancellations will also execute cancellation of any outstanding autoship orders.&nbsp; Cancellation requests must provide at least (5) Business days for Consultant Support to cancel any upcoming autoship orders otherwise Consultants will be responsible for autoships released within the (5) business days prior to cancellation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>13.7 - Account Reinstatements</strong></p>
<p>Former Kalo Consultants that wish to begin again as a Kalo Consultant must apply to have their account reinstated by contacting <a href="mailto:customersupport@Kalo.com">customersupport@Kalo.com</a>. Accounts may only be reinstated for good cause and at the discretion of Kalo. Accounts cancelled due to inactivity may be reinstated upon approval of the Compliance Department or re-enrolled without full reinstatement beginning the first day following the cancellation. Accounts cancelled for any other reason may be reinstated beginning the first day following the sixth month of cancellation. Kalo reserves the right to modify downline or sponsorship on approved reinstatements.&nbsp;</p>
